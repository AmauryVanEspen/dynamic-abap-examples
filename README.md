Dynamic ABAP Development Examples
=====================

Here you can find the four examples used by me during my session at SAP Inside Track SÃ£o Paulo 2011.

 - Reference slides: http://lucattelli.com/sap/downloads/generic_programming.pdf

More information about the examples:
 - **ZDYN01**: this first example shows you how to use FIELD-SYMBOLS in order to read/change data inside declared variables from the same or a parent variable scope.
 - **ZDYN02**: the second example demonstrates how you can use ABAP RTTS to upload/download data from almost any table from the system.
 - **ZDYN03**: the third example works as a cockpit for all table data maintainance views (a.k.a. SM30) inside a development class.
 - **ZDYN04**: the fourth and last example demonstrates how you can implement ABAP RTTS in order to create a new personal number inside SAP HCM and populate it's infotypes by copying data from an approved applicant from PB.

These examples should be used for learning purposes only, and I do not provide any kind of warranty regarding it's use on a production environment. You can copy it, learn from it, use it as a starting point for your own implementations, but do it at your own risk.

Feel free to commit changes, fixes, improvements, more examples, etc. Thanks! ;)
